# Rick and Morty characters list
![img.png](img.png)

## Description
This is test React application made by [me](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100016030623493) needed for test 
tech interview.
The goal of this app is to prove my abilities to work with REST API,
React-router, react context.

This app gets data from [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/) 
and render it on the screen. There are more than 800 characters provided by 
this API. This API provides pagination and filtering. 
You can filter characters by name, status (dead/alive) and gender.

If you click on character you will open the single character page which
contains a bit more information about the character and home icon.
You can also input single character ID into url thanks to React-Router. To
go back to all characters you can press home icon or go back button in your
browser.
